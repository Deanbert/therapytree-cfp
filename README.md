### Features

The website is comprised of five pages, four of which are accessible from the navigation menu (Homepage, FAQ's page, Happy Clients page and a Contact us page). The fifth page is a thank you page which can only be seen once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive nav bar in the header which allows the user to navigate through the site. In the left of the header is Therapy Tree text and logo. To the right of the header are the links to the websites pages (Home, FAQ's, Happy Clients and Contact Us). When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change orientation to stack on top of one another. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience.

  * A footer which contains a link to social media sites: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

* Home Page.
  * Landing Page.
  The first thing a user will see is an overview of RTT teaching them what it is.
  * About Me Section.
  This section is broken down into four subsections and gives users some information the therapist. On large screens the subsections are laid out in a row, however on mobile devices the subsections are stacked vertically.
  * Affirmations Section.
  This section is purely to promote positive vibes and make the user feel good.

* FAQ's Page.
  * Accordion Lists.
  The FAQ page uses accordions to clearly answer users questions while keeping the page tidy.
  Accordions were modified from Alvaro Trigo on Code Pen. [Alvaro-Trigo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/wvpwEdL)

  A list of testimonials from real world cusotmers.
