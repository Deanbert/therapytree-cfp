                <p>Check out my <a href="happy-clients.html">Happy Clients</a> section, I think what they have to say
                    speaks volumes to the power of this therapy!</p>

                <h2>How Rapid is Rapid Transformational Therapy?</h2>
                <p>Every client experiences a varied speed of change. Really, it all depends on the
                    customer. The best course of action is to embrace your own experience and avoid comparisons. Despite
                    this, many people do experience change and start a shift within 30 days.</p>

                <h2>What Principles Do You Use for Clients?</h2>
                <p>I have many! It is a passion full of lifelong learning. Although if a client is hesitant about
                    hypnosis, I may not use it in some circumstances. The advantage of having training in a variety
                    of theraputic practices is that it allows me to adjust as necessary. I integrate my knowledge from
                    a variety of practices which can also include Reiki and Yoga. This is because we quickly get to the
                    heart of the matter and reframe beliefs to make breakthroughs that would not be feasible with
                    conscious self-talk.</p>

                <h2>Will I Get Better Results from an Online or in Person Session?</h2>
                <p>The simple answer is no, and here's why I think online sessions are more efficient:

                    Your mind's purpose is to keep you safe; it enjoys the familiar, so when you enter a strange clinic,
                    your mind goes into immediate alert mode and the "White Coat Syndrome" kicks in and causes you to feel uneasy.
                    This has an effect on the session and how which a client may open up.

                <h2>How Will I Feel After Just One Session?</h2>
                <p>
                    My sessions are really intense. I'm there to help you achieve the greatest outcome possible. Some
                    clients claim to feel emotional, worn out, and that they simply want to roll over and sleep after
                    the session. The beautiful thing about online sessions is that you can do it from the comfort of 
                    your own bed.</p>

                <h2>Why Should I Choose You?</h2>
                <p>Finding a therapist who is right for you, who understands you, with whom you click, and who you 
                    sense is committed to your path is crucial. I take pride in this. All I want for my customers is 
                    to regain the self-confidence I once lost and use purpose to bring happiness into their lives. 
                    Every day, the work I perform with clients makes me happy. When I am with my clients, even on 
                    difficult days or when life has dealt me a curve ball, I am content. I am extremely appreciative of the enthusiasm my clients offer me.
                    That being said, if after one or two sessions you feel we have not connected I will happily recommend you to another highly reputable therapist.</p>

                <h2>How Much Does it Cost?</h2>
                <p>Cost varies from client to client and will vary depending on a number of factors, mainly how many sessions you will need.
